# Genart

This is a playground while following along with Matt DesLaurier's [Creative Coding with Canvas and WebGL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/canvas-webgl/) course.

The project files have been converted to TypeScript for developer experience.

## To run

There are a few smaller 'sketches' here. First run `npm run watch` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.

```bash
# basic canvas sketch (this one is without TypeScript)
npm run sketch

# course exercise that generates a geometric stained glass effect
npm run buildings

# introduction to webgl (revisited with shaders)
npm run webgl

# exploring webgl shaders
npm run shader
```
